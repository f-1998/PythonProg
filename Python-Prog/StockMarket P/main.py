#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.
